This is a node.js social media web application powered by MERN that provides the main functions you'd expect from a social media application, such as emojis, private messages, a personalized profile etc.

## Features

- Written in Node.JS
- NodeJS installation necessary to run the app localy.
- Stupidly [easy to install and edit]()
- open source project [`github repo` files](https://github.com/DavidJ001/Connectivate)
- Works on Mac, Linux and (maybe) Windows
- Supports other version control systems (`.hgignore`)

## Installation

After install, make sure to run `joe u`. This will download all `.gitignore` files in `~/joe-data/` folder.

### Option 1: Binary

`joe` is available for OSX (macOS), Linux and Windows.

Download the latest binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/DavidJ001/joe/releases). It's the easiest way to get started with `joe`.

Make sure to add the location of the binary to your `$PATH`.

### Option 2: From source

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:DavidJ001/joe.git
$ cd joe/
$ chmod +x tool.sh
$ ./tool.sh build
```2

## Buy me a coffee

Whether you use this project, have learned something from it, or just like it, please consider supporting it by buying me a coffee, so I can dedicate more time on open-source projects like this :)
